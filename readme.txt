Project Title: Full Stack Notes App

Description: This project is a full-stack web application for creating, managing, and deleting notes. Built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend, it implements authentication using JWT tokens to ensure secure access for users. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and manage personal notes through a clean, intuitive interface.

Key Features:

Frontend: React, HTML, CSS
Backend: Django, JWT Authentication
Deployment: Currently available only as a local demo due to hosting limitations.
Note: While deployment was covered in the tutorial, backend hosting costs prevent live deployment at the moment. However, a video demo or local run instructions are available upon request.
